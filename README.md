# Signal Reconstruction from Non-Uniform Frequency Sampling

This project demonstrates techniques for signal reconstruction from non-uniform frequency sampling, particularly focusing on image processing tasks. It provides a comprehensive walkthrough for loading images, converting them to grayscale, and applying Fourier transforms to analyze and manipulate the frequency components of the images.

## Features

- Image Loading and Grayscale Conversion: Load images from a file path and convert them to grayscale.
- Fourier Transform: Apply the Fourier transform to extract frequency components of the image.
- Inverse Fourier Transform: Reconstruct the image from its frequency components.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following packages installed to run this notebook:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- skimage
- scipy

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image scipy

## Usage

To run the notebook:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Update the image path to that in dataset folder (4.1.01.tiff)
4. Run the cells sequentially to see each step in action.
